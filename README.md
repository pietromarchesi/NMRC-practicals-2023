This repository contains the computer practicals for the course
Neural Models, Representation and Consciousness, as part of the 
Master Biomedical Sciences, track Cognitive Neurobiology and Clinical Neurophysiology, 
of the University of Amsterdam. 

# Requirements

To run the practicals, we recommend to install the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Be sure to select the Python 3.7 version. Once you have Anaconda installed, you need to create an environment as specified by the `nmrc2018.yml` configuration file. 

- Open Anaconda
- Go to the 'Environments' section
- Click 'Import'
- Select the path to the `nmrc2020.yml` and choose a name for you environment (default will be `nmrc2020`).

Once your environment has been created:
- Click on the environment name (a green triangle should appear)
- Click on the green triangle
- Select 'Open with Jupyter notebook'. This will start a Jupyter notebook in your home directory. 
- Navigate to the folder of the practicals. 

In case you get 

```Widget Javascript not detected```

You may need to enable the widget extension with 

```$ jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension```

```$ jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension```
